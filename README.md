Minesweeper game template

Minesweeper is an always solvable puzzle game. Numbers represent the amount of
mines touching the tile vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Maximum number
is obviously 8 and minimum is 0. If user presses zero, the game shows all zeros
touching it and numbers touching that area. If you press all tiles
without pressing a mine, you win. If you press a mine, you lose.

Program is an advanced version of project.
